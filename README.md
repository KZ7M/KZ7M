## 👋 About Me

I'm an aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** with a deep passion for the entire ML spectrum. My primary focus is on building a strong foundation in **Classical Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. I believe in a serious, focused, and detail-oriented approach to work — quality execution is my priority.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
*   Developing a **Python-based trading bot** for Binance, implementing scalping strategies.
*   Planning and designing a **Deep Learning model** for an upcoming project (details soon!).
*   Continuously learning and building personal projects to solidify my ML/DL knowledge.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
**Primary Language:** `Python`
**ML/DL Ecosystem:** `PyTorch` | `TensorFlow` | `scikit-learn` | `pandas` | `NumPy`
**Development & Tools:** `Git` | `Docker` (learning) | `Jupyter Notebook` | `VS Code`

### 💪 Beyond the Code
When I'm not training models, I'm training myself. I'm an avid **powerlifter** — a discipline that mirrors my professional mindset: focused, consistent, and driven by gradual, measurable improvement.
